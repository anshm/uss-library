# uss-library
These are a set of function calls in the C programming Language to facilitate networking between an Operating System running on  an Embedded system and a client computer (or another embedded system). These function calls were coupled under a single C Header  file. The networking was facilitated by implementing the uss communication protocol on top of the tcp/ip protocol stack.
